Data structures

Objectives:
  Creates an API for the main data structures: Linked List, Queue and Stack.
  Define a common interface in header files.
  Create modules for the different data structures.

Description:
  This folder contains the definition for the linked list and stack. The data
  structures are defined in their own files.

Structure:

LINKED LIST FILES
    datastructures.h     It defines the common interface.
    linklist.c           It contains the implementation of the linked list.
    mainLinklist.c       It contains the main function.
    makeList             It contains the linked list make file.

 STACK FILES:
    datastructures.h     It defines the common interface.
    stack.c              It contains the implementation fo the stack.
    linklist.c           It contains the definition of the list that is used in the stack.
    mainStack.c          It contains the main function.
    makeStack            It contains the stack make file.
