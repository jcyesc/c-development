# Final simplication of Makefile3.
# 
# As a final simplification, let's use the special macros $@ and $^, 
# which are the left and right sides of the :, respectively, to make the 
# overall compilation rule more general. In the example below, all of the 
# include files should be listed as part of the macro DEPS, and all of the 
# object files should be listed as part of the macro OBJ.
#
# Execute
#
# make -f Makefile4 clean
# make -f Makefile4 hello-make
#
# The GCC commands that are executed are:
#
# gcc -c -o hello-make.o hello-make.c -I.
# gcc -c -o hello-print.o hello-print.c -I.
# gcc -o hello-make hello-make.o hello-print.o
#

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I.
DEPS = hello-print.h
OBJ = hello-make.o hello-print.o

%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

hello-make: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS)
	
clean:
	rm hello-make hello-make.o hello-print.o
