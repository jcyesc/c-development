# This makefile makes sure that changes in .h are taken into account.
#
# This addition first creates the macro DEPS, which is the set of .h files on 
# which the .c files depend. Then we define a rule that applies to all files 
# ending in the .o suffix. The rule says that the .o file depends upon 
# the .c version of the file and the .h files included in the DEPS macro. 
# The rule then says that to generate the .o file, make needs to compile the .c file 
# using the compiler defined in the CC macro.
#
# - The -c flag says to generate the object file
# - The -o $@ says to put the output of the compilation in the file named on the left side of the :
# - The $< is the first item in the dependencies list,
# - The CFLAGS macro is defined as below.

# Execute
#
# make -f Makefile3 clean
# make -f Makefile3 hellomake
#
# The GCC commands that are executed are:
#
# gcc -c -o hello-make.o hello-make.c -I.
# gcc -c -o hello-print.o hello-print.c -I.
# gcc -o hello-make hello-make.o hello-print.o
